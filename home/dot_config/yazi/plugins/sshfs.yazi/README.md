## 🕶️ What does it do?

Mount any host from your `~/.ssh/config`, or add custom hosts, and browse remote files as if they were local. Mount specific remote directories (like `/var/log` or `/etc`) or the entire home/root filesystem. Jump between your local machine and remote mounts with a single keystroke.

## 🤔 Why SSHFS?

- **Works anywhere you have SSH access.** Nothing extra is needed – only port 22.
- **Treat remote files like local ones.** Run `vim`, `nvim`, `sed`, preview images / videos directly, etc.
- **User‑space, unprivileged.** No root required; mounts live under your chosen mount directory or the default (`~/mnt`).
- **Bandwidth‑friendly.** SSH compression, connection timeout, and reconnect options are enabled by default.
- **Quick Loading and Operations.** Load / edit files quickly without any lag and use all the tools from your local machine.

Perfect for tweaking configs, deploying sites, inspecting logs, or just grabbing / editing / deleting files remotely.

## 🧠 What it does under the hood

This plugin serves as a wrapper for the `sshfs` command, integrating it seamlessly with Yazi. It automatically reads hosts from your `~/.ssh/config` file. Additionally, it maintains a separate list of custom hosts in `~/.config/yazi/sshfs.list`.

The core default `sshfs` command used is as follows (you may tweak these options and the mount directory with your setup settings):

```sh
# Mount home directory
sshfs user@host: ~/mnt/alias -o reconnect,compression=yes,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3

# Mount specific remote directory (when configured in alias)
sshfs user@host:/var/log ~/mnt/alias-var-log -o reconnect,compression=yes,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3
```

## ✨ Features

- **One‑key mounting** – remembers your SSH hosts and reads from your `ssh_config`.
- **Jump/Return workflow** – quickly copy files between local & remote.
- Uses `sshfs` directly.
- Mount‑points live under your chosen mount directory (default: `~/mnt`), keeping them isolated from your regular file hierarchy.

## 📋 Requirements

| Software   | Minimum       | Notes                               |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Yazi       | `>=25.5.31`   | untested on 25.6+                   |
| sshfs      | any           | `sudo dnf/apt/pacman install sshfs` |
| fusermount | from FUSE     | Usually pre-installed on Linux      |
| SSH config | working hosts | Hosts come from `~/.ssh/config`     |

> [!NOTE]
> For Mac users, see the macOS setup steps below.

---

### 🍏 macOS Setup

To use **sshfs.yazi** on macOS, follow these steps:

1. **Install macFUSE**
   Download and install macFUSE from the official site:
   [https://macfuse.github.io/](https://macfuse.github.io/)

2. **Install SSHFS for macFUSE**
   Use the official SSHFS releases compatible with macFUSE:
   [https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/wiki/File-Systems-%E2%80%90-SSHFS](https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/wiki/File-Systems-%E2%80%90-SSHFS)

3. **Install Yazi**
   On macOS via Homebrew:

   ```sh
   brew install yazi
   ```

## 📦 Installation

Install the plugin via Yazi's package manager:

```sh
ya pkg add uhs-robert/sshfs
```

Then add the following to your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua` to enable the plugin with default settings:

```lua
require("sshfs"):setup()
```

## 🎹 Key Mapping

### 🗝️ Recommended: Preset

Add this to your `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml` for a conflict-free approach that works well with other plugins:

```toml
[mgr]
prepend_keymap = [
  { on = ["M","s"], run = "plugin sshfs -- menu",            desc = "Open SSHFS options" },
]
```

The `M s` menu provides access to all SSHFS functions:

- `m` → Mount & jump
- `u` → Unmount
- `j` → Jump to mount
- `a` → Add host
- `r` → Remove host
- `h` → Go to mount home
- `c` → Open ~/.ssh/config

> [!TIP]
> `sshfs.yazi` uses the [array form for keymaps](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/keymap).
> You must pick **only one style** per file; mixing with `[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]` will fail.
>
> **Also note:** some plugins (e.g., `mount.yazi`) bind a bare key like `on = "M"`,
> which blocks all `M <key>` chords (including `M s`). Change those to chords
> (e.g. `["M","m"]`) or choose a different prefix.

---

### 🛠️ Alternative: Custom direct keybinds

If you prefer direct keybinds, you may also set your own using our API. Here are the available options from the default preset:

```toml
[mgr]
prepend_keymap = [
  { on = ["M","m"], run = "plugin sshfs -- mount --jump",    desc = "Mount & jump" },
  { on = ["M","u"], run = "plugin sshfs -- unmount",         desc = "Unmount SSHFS" },
  { on = ["M","j"], run = "plugin sshfs -- jump",            desc = "Jump to mount" },
  { on = ["M","a"], run = "plugin sshfs -- add",             desc = "Add SSH host" },
  { on = ["M","r"], run = "plugin sshfs -- remove",          desc = "Remove SSH host" },
  { on = ["M","h"], run = "plugin sshfs -- home",            desc = "Go to mount home" },
  { on = ["M","c"], run = "cd ~/.ssh/",                      desc = "Go to ssh config" },
]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to use direct keybinds, you will be responsible for managing and handling any conflicts yourself.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📝 Example using the recommended preset

- **SSHFS Menu (`M s`):** Opens an interactive menu with all SSHFS options
  - **Mount (`M m`):** Choose a host and select a remote directory (`~` or `/`). This works for hosts from your `~/.ssh/config` and any custom hosts you've added. Custom hosts with specific remote paths configured will mount directly to that path.
  - **Unmount (`M u`):** Choose an active mount to unmount it.
  - **Jump to mount (`M j`):** Jump to any active mount from another tab or location
  - **Add host (`M a`):** Enter a custom host (`user@host`) and optionally specify a remote directory (e.g., `/var/log`, `/etc/nginx`) to create an alias for that specific path. When you mount this alias later, it will go directly to that remote directory. This is useful for frequently accessed remote directories or quick testing. For persistent, system-wide access, updating your `.ssh/config` is recommended.
  - **Remove host (`M r`):** Select and remove any Yazi-only hosts that you've added.
  - **Jump to mount home directory (`M h`):** Jump to the mount home directory.

## 💡 Tips and Performance

- If key authentication fails, the plugin will prompt for a password up to 3 times before giving up.
- SSH keys vastly speed up repeated mounts (no password prompt), leverage your `ssh_config` rather than manually adding hosts to make this as easy as possible.
- **User Selection**: By setting `default_user = "prompt"` in your configuration, you can choose which user to login as when mounting (SSH config user, root, or custom username). This is useful when you need to switch between different user contexts on the same host. The default setting (`"auto"`) respects your SSH config without prompting.

## ⚙️ Configuration

> [!WARNING]
> This section is intended for power users only.
> Skip this if you only want to run the default settings.
> Keep reading for advanced SSHFS customization and plugin configuration options.

To customize plugin behavior, you may pass a config table to `setup()` (default settings are displayed for optional configuration):

```lua
require("sshfs"):setup({
  -- Mount directory
  mount_dir = os.getenv("HOME") .. "/mnt",

  -- Password authentication attempts before giving up
  password_attempts = 3,

  -- Default mount point: Go to home, root, or always ask where to go
  default_mount_point = "auto", -- home | root | auto

  -- Default user selection: Use SSH config user or prompt for choice
  default_user = "auto", -- auto | prompt

  -- SSHFS mount options (array of strings)
  -- These options are passed directly to the sshfs command
  sshfs_options = {
    "reconnect",                      -- Auto-reconnect on connection loss
    "ConnectTimeout=5",               -- Connection timeout in seconds
    "compression=yes",                -- Enable compression
    "ServerAliveInterval=15",         -- Keep-alive interval (15s × 3 = 45s timeout)
    "ServerAliveCountMax=3",          -- Keep-alive message count
    -- "dir_cache=yes",               -- Enable directory caching (default: yes)
    -- "dcache_timeout=300",          -- Cache timeout in seconds
    -- "dcache_max_size=10000",       -- Max cache size
    -- "allow_other",                 -- Allow other users to access mount
    -- "uid=1000,gid=1000",           -- Set file ownership
    -- "follow_symlinks",             -- Follow symbolic links
  },

  -- Picker UI settings
  ui = {
    -- Maximum number of items to show in the menu picker.
    -- If the list exceeds this number, a different picker (like fzf) is used.
    menu_max = 15, -- Recommended: 10–20. Max: 36.

    -- Picker strategy:
    -- "auto": uses menu if items <= menu_max, otherwise fzf (if available) or a filterable list
    -- "fzf": always use fzf if available, otherwise fallback to a filterable list
    picker = "auto", -- "auto" | "fzf"
  },
})
```

All sshfs options are specified in the `sshfs_options` array. You can learn more about [sshfs mount options here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sshfs.1.html).

In addition, sshfs also supports a variety of options from [sftp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sftp.1.html) and [ssh_config](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ssh_config.5.html).
