# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code.

- Code should be easy to read and understand.
- Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent.
- Functions should be small and do one thing well. They should not exceed a few lines.
- Function names should describe the action being performed.
- Prefer fewer arguments in functions. Ideally, aim for no more than two or three.
- Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive\
  to make the code self-explanatory.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily\
  apparent from the code itself.
- Properly handle errors and exceptions to ensure the software's robustness.
- Use exceptions rather than error codes for handling errors.
- Consider security implications of the code. Implement security best practices\
  to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), \
  bug free, fully functional and working code
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode\
  , written out in great detail.
- Always create unit tests for new features, try to keep code coverage above \
  80%. Keep these tests simple and only test the most critical functionality.
- Use TDD (Test driven development), first create tests on what you expect the code to do, and create code to pass those tests.
- Commit code for fixes, refactors, minor and major fixes.

## MCP Servers available

The following are MCP servers that I have provided which you should use when needed:

- GitLab MCP Server: Access my local self-hosted GitLab instance.
- GitHub MCP Server: Access my GitHub account.
- Context7 MCP Server: This is used to get documentation data for languages and frameworks that we will use.
- Supermemory MCP Server: Use this as a memory store to store things that you think you need to keep for long term
- Linear MCP Server: Linear is my project management tool, use this MCP server to get or update details about projects I am working on.

## Memories

- `/home/ll931217/.config/zsh/aliases.zsh` please read this file for updated aliases that could cause issues for running commands
